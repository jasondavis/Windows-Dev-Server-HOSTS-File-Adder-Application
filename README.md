The example below shows the basic usage to add a domain entry to my WIndows HOSTS file named `dev-project.dev`

Simply call the application `set-dev-server-domain-hosts-file-entry.exe` followed by a space and then the name of the desired DOmain name to add to the HOSTS file.

## Usage

    // Add record to Windows HOSTS file
    // HOSTS file C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\HOSTS
    @exec('set-dev-server-domain-hosts-file-entry.exe dev-project.dev');
